# reith-download
I was too lazy to use the BBC UI to listen.

On that basis, I created this little script to download the non-drm versions of the MP3 files so I could listen using my preferred app. 

The Beeb clearly own the copyright on these if you do use the script so be good.

Download.php downloads the MP3 files into a folder called lectures. I might refactor it to double check the file doesn't exist first if time permits as some of them download twice.  

List.php (which I wrote to run in a browser) outputs a list of the lectures and where to download them from. I might improve this to output a CSV if time permits.
